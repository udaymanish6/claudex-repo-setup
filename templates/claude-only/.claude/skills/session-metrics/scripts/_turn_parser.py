    """Deduplicate on message.id and return one entry per assistant turn.

    Claude Code writes a single assistant response across **multiple JSONL
    entries** that all share the same ``message.id`` and an identical
    ``usage`` dict, but each carries a **different single content block**
    (one thinking block, one text block, one tool_use block, etc.).  This
    is how Anthropic's streaming output is persisted.  Dedup strategy:

    - ``usage``, ``model``, and timestamp come from the **last** occurrence
      (canonical "message settled" snapshot; cost math was always correct
      because ``usage`` is constant across occurrences).
    - ``content`` is the **union** of content blocks across **every**
      occurrence (so the turn record reflects the full thinking + text +
      tool_use distribution the model actually emitted).  Empirically,
      each occurrence contributes exactly one distinct block and they never
      overlap; if Claude Code ever starts shipping cumulative snapshots
      alongside incremental ones, we'd need to dedup block-by-block here.

    Each returned entry has ``_preceding_user_content`` attached — the
    ``message.content`` of the user entry immediately before this turn's
    **first** occurrence in the raw stream (content-block counters use
    this to attribute ``tool_result`` / ``image`` blocks to the turn that
    consumed them).

    Also attaches ``_is_resume_marker``: True when the turn is a synthetic
    no-op whose preceding ``_RESUME_LOOKBACK_USER_ENTRIES`` user entries
    carry either of two high-precision fingerprints:

    - A ``/exit`` local-command triplet (``claude -c`` resume, Session 22).
    - A ``"Continue from where you left off."`` isMeta user entry (desktop
      auto-continue placeholder, Session 34 — typically a five-hour
      rate-limit backoff where the client couldn't reach the API).

    Precision is high (both fingerprints are client-generated and the
    ``<synthetic>`` assistant reply is unambiguous); recall is incomplete
    (resumes after Ctrl+C / crash leave no trace).

    """Extract context-compaction events from raw JSONL entries.

    Claude Code records a compaction as a ``system`` entry with
    ``subtype:"compact_boundary"`` carrying a ``compactMetadata`` object,
    immediately followed by a ``user`` entry with ``isCompactSummary:true``
    (the summary that starts with "This session is being continued…").
    These entries are ``type != "assistant"`` so ``_extract_turns`` drops
    them — this is the only place they are surfaced.

    Two manifestations (see CLAUDE-compaction-operations.md): a mid-session
    in-place boundary, or a resume-start head boundary at the top of a new
    session file. ``starts_with_summary`` flags the latter (the file *begins*
    as a continuation of a prior conversation).

    MAIN-SESSION boundaries only: subagents ALSO get compacted (their JSONLs
    carry their own ``compact_boundary`` entries — verified empirically), but
    those are internal to a one-shot agent run and don't affect the user's
    conversation flow or lineage, so entries tagged ``_subagent_agent_id``
    (set by ``_load_session`` when merging subagent logs) are skipped. This
    is what makes post-dedup extraction over the merged entries list safe.

    All ``compactMetadata`` fields are treated as OPTIONAL — older Claude Code
    builds omit ``preCompactDiscoveredTools``/``preservedSegment``/
