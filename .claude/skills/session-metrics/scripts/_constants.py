"""Shared literals consumed at function-def time.

Constants imported here cannot be replaced with `_sm()._NAME` lookups because
they are referenced as default-argument values (`def fn(x: int = _NAME)`),
which Python evaluates at def-time — before `_sm()` (the orchestrator
back-reference) is wired up. Keep this leaf dependency-free so it can be the
first one `session-metrics.py` loads.
