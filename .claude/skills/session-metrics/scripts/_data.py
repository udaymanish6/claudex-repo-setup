    """Group turns into deterministic "request units" by prompt anchor.

    A **request unit** = every turn sharing one ``prompt_anchor_index`` —
    i.e. all assistant/tool/subagent work caused by a single user prompt.
    Subagent turns inherit their spawning prompt's anchor
    (``_compute_prompt_anchor_indices``), so a unit's combined cost already
    captures the subagent chain. This is a *per-utterance* carve-up, NOT a
    semantic task: one prompt can bundle several asks and one task can span
    many follow-up prompts. The honest UI label is "per-request breakdown".

    Cost invariant: summing each unit's ``combined_cost_usd`` over a session
    reproduces that session's ``subtotal.cost`` to float precision, because
    every non-resume turn lands in exactly one unit and ``cost_usd`` is summed
    over the whole group (the headline total is itself parent + subagent
    direct cost). Tool histogram and waste signals aggregate over the MAIN
    (non-subagent) turns only — they describe the main-thread work; subagent
    internals are covered by the subagent / workflow tables.

    The grouping key is the compound ``(session_id, anchor_index)`` so project
    and instance scopes keep per-session units distinct (global turn indices
    are unique today, but a unit's identity should not depend on that).

        with ``input.subagent_type``). Always available.

        tagging). Only populated when the user ran with
        ``--include-subagents``; without it the token columns are all zero.

    The row ``name`` is the resolved subagent type string. Rows for spawn
    events whose type wasn't observed among the loaded subagent files still
    appear (with zero tokens) so users see the spawn signal even when the
    subagent JSONL wasn't loaded.
